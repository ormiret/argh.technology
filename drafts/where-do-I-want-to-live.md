My previous thinking on this was that I wanted to live in a city to have bars, shops, museums etc. within walking distance. I wanted somewhere English speaking so I could have a social life. 


I had previously been pretty sure I wanted to live in a city as I like having shops, bars, cultural venues etc. within walking distance. But it's now been more than 4 months of them being mostly shut, and I'm not missing them as much as I thought I would. 

Moving to somewhere remote could have advantages: more space, not have neighbours to worry about, could get somewhere with a decent view.

Downsides: less good internet (probably, there are a couple of remote places with fibre), rural properties are more expensive than something the same size in a town/city unless you go out onto the islands. I don't think I want to move to one of the islands - having to deal with ferries would add a lot of time to going anywhere (I'm not likely to be going anywhere often/at all over the next year or so but if the world gets back to normal, I will get back to travelling 1 week/month or so, I'm OK with adding a couple of hours of driving to get to an airport, but adding a ferry trip into that is likely to shift an early start into having to leave the day before plus ferries don't sail more often than planes don't fly for weather issues).
