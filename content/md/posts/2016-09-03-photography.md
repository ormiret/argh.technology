I was thinking today that I haven't been doing much photography lately. Given I had a bit of free time the obvious thing to do would have been to get out my camera and take some pictures. 

I don't like to do the obvious thing. 

Instead I started thinking about a process to get me taking more pictures. I decided I should set myself a schedule that I can keep to of shooting something. I've previously tried a daily schedule (with a group all shooting on the same theme each day) but within a week I got distracted by other things and then forgot about it. This time I think I'll try weekly. 

With that decided I needed an idea of some subject matter. For the few days I stuck to the daily shooting I quite liked getting a theme and having to find something to fit it.  I tended to interpret the theme quite loosely, but it was a good starting point. 

So, rather than actually picking up a camera this afternoon I have assembled a [list of themes](https://github.com/ormiret/photo-themes) and put together [a website](http://theme.bodaegl.com) to pick one from the list.
