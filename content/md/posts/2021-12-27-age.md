Last week someone gave me their age using a numeric base larger than 10 to reduce the number of years. This got me thinking about other ways to mess with ages. 

Years are different on other planets and we probably know of enough exoplanets now to give pretty good translation to any age you want...

### How 

I got a CSV of exoplanet data from [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html), did some faffing in python REPL to make a [json file](https://github.com/ormiret/misc/blob/main/planets/planets.json) from that with just name and period, then wrote [some nim](https://github.com/ormiret/misc/blob/main/planets/planets.nim) to find the best of those planets for the desired age.
