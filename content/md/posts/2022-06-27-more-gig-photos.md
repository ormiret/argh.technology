Since my [last post](/posts-output/2022-06-13-gig-photos/) I have been along to a few more heats of Krakatoa's battle of the bands. For some of them I took pictures. And I have now got round to processing those pictures. Definitely still rusty but I think getting better. 

The heat numbering seems to have gotten broken: there was a heat between heat's 4 and 5 in [the listings](https://www.57north.org/listings/2022/06) so I'm just going to go for dates.

I think I need to figure something else out as an index for galleries. I like my [simple static gallery generator](https://github.com/ormiret/gallerygen) and then chucking the files into whatever web hosting I feel like but could do with a single jumping off point to link to individual galleries.
