I have decided to move to a new site and a new system for blogging.

This is being generated with [cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org) to make the server side really simple and save me having to worry about code there breaking.

Writing things for this is a lot closer to my normal work flow (I write something in emacs and then run some commands to make it appear here) so hopefully I'll actually put more on here than I have on previous attempts at blogging.  

It looks like it won't be a huge amount of work to pull the content from my old site into this - I'll put that on the TODO list and might get to it some time before the heat death of the universe.

I must always remember: no one cares about this blog.
