As Warren Ellis [recently mentioned](http://morning.computer/2018/04/network-effects/): once upon a time if your kink was one in a million you needed to be in a fairly big city to find a single digit number of people who might be on the same page. 

Finding them was a non-trivial exercise. 

Those days are past (but recent enough that I can remember them). 

The internet now connects [3.something billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage). A one in a million kink lumps you in with a few thousand people. And they're only a Google search away. 

You need to be a couple orders of magnitude further off the beaten track if you want to stand out these days.
