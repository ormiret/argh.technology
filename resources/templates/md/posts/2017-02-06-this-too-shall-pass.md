I love this adage. Having read [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass) on it (you have to like any sentence that has its own Wikipedia article) I seem to be in good company; there's wise men, various royals and Abe Lincoln. 

One of my plans for if/when I have stupid amounts of money to throw at frivolous projects: write this somewhere that the passing will take a while.

I can probably afford to get it carved in a lump of granite now. Wandering round a graveyard gives you an idea of how long that'll take to pass. I put it at a couple of centuries (if you can stop future people finding a better use for the chunk of granite for that long). 

I like the idea of making a standing stones version of the phrase. Stone henge, and [the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stone_circles) [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Brodgar) [stone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Tyrebagger_Stone_Circle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_257895.jpg) [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Aquhorthies_stone_circle), suggest that these can last a few millenia. Though we don't really know how many didn't survive...

Next step up would be to reshape a mountain to spell it out. [Mt Rushmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore) style. A [quick Google](https://atkinsbookshelf.wordpress.com/tag/what-would-it-cost-to-build-mount-rushmore-now/) puts the cost of that on the order of $10 billion. A bit out of my price range at the moment. But about pocket change for a decent sized government. Anybody contemplating a [bank bailout](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/12/reality-check-banking-bailout) or a couple of [aircraft carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier): how about carving a mountain to say "This too shall pass" instead? 

Properly into mad billionaire territory (I'm looking at you Elon Musk) we could write it on the moon. I could take a swing at figuring out what that would take and how long it would last but this seems like the kind of problem that can be outsourced to [xkcd/what if](https://what-if.xkcd.com/). I have submitted it so I guess we'll see if Randall's productivity is sufficiently superior to mine that he gets to a random submission before I get round to looking into something I've actually wondered about.
