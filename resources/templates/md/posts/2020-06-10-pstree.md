I use `pstree` every so often to investigate how something was called or what something has spawned. I almost always want the same behaviour: show me parents and children of this process, with PIDs and usernames. To get that I should use `pstree -sup <PID>`.

Now I should know where to look when I can't remember what the options I want are.
